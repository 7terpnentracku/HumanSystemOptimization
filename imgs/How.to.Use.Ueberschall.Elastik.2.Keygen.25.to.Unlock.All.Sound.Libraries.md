- The Loopeye: This is the central editing surface where you can focus on the loop. You can adjust various parameters such as pitch, volume, pan, reverse, formant, filter and resample. You can also use the ReTune tab to change the scale and key of any tonal loop, even with polyphonic material. You can record all your cursor movements for automation purposes. You can also use the Sequence mode to slice up your loop and access a multitude of editing features for each slice.
- The Inspire: This is a powerful feature that allows you to create new loops and sounds by randomly replacing parts of the original loop with similar sounds from the same or different sound libraries. You can control the degree of randomness and variation with a simple slider.
- The Sync: This is an essential feature that ensures that your loops are always in sync with your host tempo and time signature. Elastik 2 uses the advanced Ã©lastique pro algorithm by zplane.development to provide high-quality time-stretching and pitch-shifting in real time.
